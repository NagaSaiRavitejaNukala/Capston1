		<div class="two"><span>Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. <br>The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers end-user<br> retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant  peddlers  wandering  from  village  to hamlet, gyrovagues <br>(wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrel<br> toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.

			Travel provides a fantastic opportunity for you to learn many new things. Yes, you gain knowledge from travel guides, and you may be able to visualize what you are reading about but nothing compares to actually feeling the sun on your face or the snow in your hair. When you experience standing on the soil, looking at the things of those you read about, the experience is exhilarating and irreplaceable.

            Many travelers stand in awe of what they are surrounded by, drinking in every experience as if it were a glass of wine aged to perfection. While traveling, you do not just learn about new places, you also learn to relate with people living in different parts of the world that may look and live very much differently from you. When visiting your travel destination, you learn about the diversity in geography as well as the global culture. Listening new languages, eating various types of cuisine is also learning in itself.<br><br>

			Although we all want to have a superfluous vacation where the sky is the limit and we want to bring everything home with us from our vacation. It is a good idea to couple budgeting with travel, think of taking trips in the off season or travel with friends to reduce the cost of lodging.<br><br><br>
